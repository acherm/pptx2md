# Converting Powerpoint files (pptx) into Markdown format

The plan is to migrate pptx files into sustainable formats like Markdown (the hidden goal is to reuse presentations frameworks like https://github.com/remarkjs). 
I am relying on this nice library: https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx

So far, a basic HTML convertion has been implemented
